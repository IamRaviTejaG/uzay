# Uzay

Uzay is a neatly written API using Express to serve as the basic backend for my personal blog. 

### Features

Here's a list of some features included in the bundle :

* __Highly modular__ : All code is written neatly as separate independent modules, providing high flexibility for debugging and testing.
* __Highly anonymous__ : No Passport or any similar policies used to authenticate users. Usage of alias is encouraged, however, a working email is also required once to avoid bullshit.
* __Highly secure__ : A single passphrase heavily encrypted assures that Bloggers identity remains safe and with the Blogger only.
* __User Friendly Install__ : Post Install Script helps you set up the passphrase in the same go, for once and for all. No manually editing of the files required. Deploy ahoy!
* __Minimalistic Admin Page__ : The Admin Page (/admin) provides a simple yet attractive UI where you can write your blog post. 
* __Accept Public Upvotes__ : Because at times, we just need to say a simple "Thank You!". Why log into whatever ? Just say! This does exactly that.

And many more !
